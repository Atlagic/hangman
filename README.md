# Hangman Game

Hangman game is a React + TypeScript word-guessing game. Players guess a hidden word one letter at a time, while incorrect guesses “eliminate” programming languages.

This project demonstrates:

- TypeScript integration – strongly typed components, props, and state
- React component architecture – modular and reusable UI components
- State management – dynamic updates for correct and incorrect guesses
- Interactive UI – clickable keyboard and visual feedback for game actions
- Conditional rendering – displaying win/lose states and language elimination
